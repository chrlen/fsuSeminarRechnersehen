#Abstract

This paper deals with local 3D descriptors for surface matching.

Two classes of Models:
	-> Signatures
	-> Histograms

Discussion/experiments -> key issues of uniqueness and repeatabillity
observations 	-> new unique and repeatable local reference frame + new descriptor
new descriptor 	-> lies at intersection between 	Signatures and histogram
				-> possibly better balance between descriptiveness and robustnes

Validated on public Data-Sets
					range scans obtained with "Spacetime Stereo"

Last 15 Years: Most Popular Trend 
	Compact local representation of input data, known as descriptor
	Shares basic motivation with the successful approaches for matching 2D images.

Use local correspondeces matched by descriptors to solve higher level problems such as 3D object recognition
	-> deal effectively with problems such as occlusion,clutter and changes of viewpoint
